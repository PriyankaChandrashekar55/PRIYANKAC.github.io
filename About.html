    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & 
        Company. The website started as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the 
        company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a 
        potential naming conflict with eBay.
        Zomato logo in 2012 With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx,
        a site dedicated to food porn.
        In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and 
        Hyderabad. In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including 
        the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,Qatar, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, 
        and South Africa.In 2013, it expanded to New Zealand, Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia, with 
        websites and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and English languages. In April 
        2014, it was launched in Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon, and Ireland
